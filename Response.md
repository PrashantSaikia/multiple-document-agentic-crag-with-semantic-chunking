# light dues
To calculate the light dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban, we need to use the information provided in the document and the vessel details.

The document states that for all other vessels, light dues are charged per 100 tons or part thereof. The charge is 117.08 per 100 tons.

The vessel's Gross Tonnage (GT) is 51,300. We need to calculate the light dues based on this GT.

1. Determine the number of 100-ton units in the vessel's GT:
   - 51,300 GT / 100 = 513 units

2. Calculate the light dues:
   - 513 units * 117.08 = 60,059.04

Therefore, the light dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban would be 60,059.04.

# port dues
To calculate the port dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban, we need to use the gross tonnage (GT) of the vessel, which is 51,300 GT.

1. **Basic Fee Calculation:**
   - The basic fee is charged per 100 tons or part thereof.
   - GT = 51,300
   - Number of 100-ton units = 51,300 / 100 = 513

   Basic fee = 513 units * 192.73 = 98,911.49

2. **Incremental Fee Calculation:**
   - The incremental fee is charged per 100 tons or part thereof per 24-hour period.
   - Number of 100-ton units = 513
   - Number of days = 3.396

   Incremental fee = 513 units * 57.79 * 3.396 days = 100,497.77

3. **Total Port Dues:**
   - Total port dues = Basic fee + Incremental fee
   - Total port dues = 98,911.49 + 100,497.77 = 199,409.26

Therefore, the port dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban would be 199,409.26.

# line handling dues
To calculate the line handling dues for the vessel at the port of Durban, we need to consider the number of operations mentioned, which is 2. The relevant section for line handling dues is "RUNNING OF VESSEL LINES," and since the document does not specifically mention the port of Durban, we use the charges for "Other Ports."

The charge for running of vessel lines per service at "Other Ports" is 1,654.56. Since there are 2 operations, we multiply this charge by 2:

Line handling dues = 1,654.56 * 2 = 3,309.12

Therefore, the line handling dues for the vessel at the port of Durban would be 3,309.12.

# pilotage dues
To calculate the pilotage dues for the vessel SUDESTADA arriving at the port of Durban, we need to consider the following:

1. **Base Charge for Durban**: The base charge for pilotage services at the port of Durban is 18,608.61 ZAR per service (normal entering or leaving the port).

2. **Additional Charge per 100 Tons**: The vessel has a Gross Tonnage (GT) of 51,300. The additional charge is 9.72 ZAR per 100 tons or part thereof.

   - Calculate the number of 100-ton units: 51,300 / 100 = 513 units.
   - Additional charge: 513 units * 9.72 ZAR = 4,989.36 ZAR.

3. **Total Charge for One Operation**: Add the base charge and the additional charge for one operation:
   - Total for one operation: 18,608.61 ZAR + 4,989.36 ZAR = 23,597.97 ZAR.

4. **Number of Operations**: The vessel has 2 operations (loading and unloading).

5. **Total Pilotage Dues**: Multiply the total charge for one operation by the number of operations:
   - Total pilotage dues: 23,597.97 ZAR * 2 = 47,195.94 ZAR.

Therefore, the pilotage dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban, considering 2 operations, would be 47,195.94 ZAR.

# towage dues
To calculate the towage dues for the vessel "SUDESTADA" at the port of Durban, we need to consider the vessel's tonnage and the number of operations.

1. **Vessel Tonnage**: The vessel has a DWT of 93,274 and a GT of 51,300. For the purpose of port tariffs, we typically use the Gross Tonnage (GT). Therefore, the vessel falls into the "50,001 to 100,000" tonnage category.

2. **Base Charge for 50,001 to 100,000 GT at Durban**: According to the document, the base charge for a vessel in this tonnage range at the port of Durban is 73,118.07.

3. **Number of Operations**: The document states that line handling dues, pilotage dues, and towage dues depend on the number of operations. Since there are 2 operations (loading and unloading), we need to multiply the base charge by 2.

Therefore, the towage dues for the vessel "SUDESTADA" at the port of Durban would be:

73,118.07 (base charge) x 2 (number of operations) = 146,236.14

The towage dues are 146,236.14 South African Rand.

# vts dues
To calculate the VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) dues for the vessel SUDESTADA arriving at the port of Durban, we need to use the charge specified for Durban, which is 0.65 per GT per port call.

The vessel's GT (Gross Tonnage) is 51,300.

VTS dues = Charge per GT per port call * GT
VTS dues = 0.65 * 51,300

VTS dues = 33,345

Therefore, the VTS dues for the vessel SUDESTADA at the port of Durban would be 33,345.
